# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

This work was done as part of CSCI-567 (Machine Learning) coursework at USC. I have implemented a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier, Perceptron algorithm and Linear Regression on breast_cancer sklearn dataset and evaluated them.

It is implemented in python3 (3.4), with the following python packages :
-   numpy (1.14.0)
-   scipy (0.19.1)
-   sklearn (0.19.0)
-   matplotlib (2.1.2)
-   jupyter (1.0.0)
